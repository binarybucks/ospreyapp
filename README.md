# Osprey

Osprey is a free and open source Mac instant messaging client for XMPP networks such as Google Talk or Facebook. 
While there are many clients for Mac that also offer great features, most of them do not feel native or are no longer maintained. 
Osprey tries to change that by bringing a lightweight application with a minimalistic interface to the Mac.

Head over to [Ospreyapp.org](http://ospreyapp.org) to get the latest version and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ospreyapp/) for updates.
